/// Calculate the next element for a given history.
///
/// ## Example
/// Assume the history input `10 13 16 21 30 45`:
/// ```text
/// 10  13  16  21  30  45    <-- Line 0 (original history)
///       3   5   9  15       <-- Line 1 (all differences of line 0)
///         2   4   6         <-- Line 2 (all differences of line 1)
///           2   2           <-- Line 3 (all differences of line 2)
///             0             <-- Line 4 (all differences of line 3)
/// ```
///
///## Solution
/// The solution to this example is `68`. To calculate it,
/// the next difference needs to be determined:
/// * Because of `line 4`, all diffs in `line 3` have to be `2`.
/// * In `line 2`, the new diff in `line 4` would be calculated with `X - 6 = 2`,
///   so the new diff here is `8`.
/// * In `line 1` the new diff would be `23` accordingly.
/// * When adding this diff to the last number `45` in `line 0`, we get the solution `68`.
///
/// ## Algorithm
/// * Notice that we can just accumulate the last diagonal to the right: `2 + 6 + 15 + 45 = 68`
/// * Furthermore, the first element is not even needed to calculate all needed diffs
/// * We reverse the history, so we effectively iterate it from the back, ignoring
///   unneeded entries at the back
/// * Thus we want to calculate all entries on the right diagonale.
/// * Values we already used can be overwritten, so entries can be reused for calculated diffs
///
/// ## Steps
/// **Notes**
/// * History content depicted in reverse order for better overview,
///   i.e. last element has Position `0`.
/// * Entries marked with `x` are not taken into account anymore for the rest of the algorithm.
///
/// **Step 0**
/// * First add `45` to the `accumulator`: `accumulator == 45`
/// * Then calculate the `line 1` diffs: `45 - 30 = 15` and so on...
/// * Store them in the history list`: `x 3 5 9 15`
/// * Range that is taken into account contains still 4 elements => continue
///
/// **Step 1**
/// * Add `15` (stored in first element) to `accumulator`: `accumulator == 60`
/// * Calculate `line 2` diffs: `15 - 9 = 6` and so on...
/// * Store them in the history list`: `x x 2 4 6`
/// * Range that is taken into account contains still 3 elements => continue
///
/// **Step 2**
/// * Add `6` to `accumulator`: `accumulator == 66`
/// * Calculate `line 3` diffs: `6 - 4 = 2` and so on...
/// * Store them in the history list`: `x x x 2 2`
/// * Range that is taken into account contains still 2 elements => continue
///
/// **Step 3**
/// * Add `2` to `accumulator`: `accumulator == 68`
/// * Calculate `line 4` diffs: `2 - 2 = 0`
/// * Store them in the history list`: `x x x x 0`
/// * Range that is taken into account contains still 1 element => continue
///
/// **Step 4**
/// * No more diffs to calculate, stop loop
///
/// ## Asymptotic order
/// Should be `O(nÂ²)` if I'm not mistaken.
